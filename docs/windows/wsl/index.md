# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a utility for running Linux under Windows. It's an impressive project that works very well, allowing you to have a nearly fully-featured Bash prompt (including systemd, if enabled) on a Windows machine.

VSCode even supports developing inside a WSL machine, using the Remote Explorer plugin.
