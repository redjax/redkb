# Resticprofile

[`resticprofile`](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile) is a wrapper for `restic` that manages your backups as "profiles". You can split your backups into separate YAML files, or use the standard `~/profiles.yaml` to store all of your profiles.

!!! warning

    This documentation does not cover all of the capabilities of this tool. You should read the [`resticprofile` docs](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/index.html) yourself to learn how to operate it.
