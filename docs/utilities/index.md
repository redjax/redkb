# Utilities

Documentation for software utilities, like terminal emulators ([Alacritty](./alacritty/index.md)), Bash utilities ([`rsync`](./rsync/index.md), [`ssh`](./ssh/index.md), etc), and more.

!!! info

    Some documentation for utilities is under another section, because that is where I would expect to find it when browsing around this site. If a documentation page is nested under another section and becomes large enough to warrant moving to this path, I will do that (make note of this if you bookmark pages and the link breaks).
