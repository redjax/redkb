# Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an engine for running containerized apps. It's a powerful tool for development, and for simplifying deployment of production applications.

Paired with an orchestrator like [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), or [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/), Docker containers can create a mostly-reproducible environment to ensure an application runs the same with the same inputs across hosts.
