# Parse arguments with Cyclopts

## Overview

[`cyclopts`](https://cyclopts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python library that helps with building CLI/TUI applications. It is inspired by and comparable to libraries like [`click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), [`fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire), and [`Typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com), and in fact directly compares itself to `Typer` in a number of instances.

`cyclopts` helps to reduce boilerplate code, and allows for flexible structuring of your code in files. It makes adding commands and `--args` simple, and can handle some fairly complex configurations, or very simple argument parsing.

Use the sections on the left to read more about using `cyclopts` to build CLIs for your apps.
