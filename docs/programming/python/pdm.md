## What is PDM?

PDM (Python Dependency Manager) is a tool that helps manage Python projects & dependencies. It does many things, but a simple way to describe it is that it replaces `virtualenv` and `pip`, and ensures when you install dependencies, they will be compatible with the current Python version and other dependencies you add to the project. Some dependencies require other dependencies, and where `pip` might give you an error about a `ModuleNotFound`, `pdm` is smart enough to see that there are extra dependencies and will automatically add them as it installs the dependency you asked for.

## What problem does PDM solve?

If you have already used tools like `poetry` or `conda`, you are familiar with the problem `pdm` solves. In a nutshell, dependency management in Python is painful, frustrating, and difficult. `pdm` (and other similar tools) try to solve this problem using a "dependency matrix," which ensures the dependencies you add to your project remain compatible with each other. This approach helps avoid "dependency hell," keeps your packages isolated to the project they were installed for, and skips the `ModuleNotFound` error you will see in `pip` when a dependency requires other dependencies to install.

`pdm` is also useful for sharing code, as anyone else who uses `pdm` can install the *exact same* set of dependencies that you installed on your machine. This is accomplished using a "lockfile," which is a special `pdm.lock` file the `pdm` tool creates any time you install a dependency in your project. Unless you manually update the package, any time you run `pdm install`, it will install the exact same set of dependencies, down to the minor release number, keeping surprise errors at bay if you update a package that does not "fit" in your current environment by ensuring a specific, compatible version of that package is installed.

`pdm` can also help you build your projects and publish them to `pypi`, and can install your development tools (like `black`, `ruff`, `pytest`, etc) outside of your project's environment, separating development and production dependencies. `pdm` also makes it easy to create dependency "groups," where a user can install your package with syntax like `package_name[group]`. You may have seen this syntax in the `pandas` or `uvicorn` packages, where the documentation will tell you to install like `pandas[excel]` or `uvicorn[standard]`. The maintainers of these packages have created different dependency "groups," where if you only need the Excel functionality included in `pandas`, for example, it will only install the dependencies required for that group, instead of all of the dependencies the `pandas` package requires.

Lastly, `pdm` can make you more efficient by providing [functionality for scripting](https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/scripts/). With `pdm`, you can create scripts like `start` or `start-dev` to control executing commands you would manually re-type each time you wanted to run them.
