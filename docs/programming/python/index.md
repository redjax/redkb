# Python

Notes, links, & reference code for Python programming. Also check the [Python "standard project files" section](../standard-project-files/python/) for copy/paste-able code for things like [a `[tool.ruff]` section for your `pyproject.toml`](../standard-project-files/python/ruff/pyproject-ruff.md).

This section has documentation for things like:

- [Managing your Python install with `pyenv`](pyenv.md)
- [Managing your project with the `pdm` tool](pdm.md)
- [Documentation & example sessions for `nox`](nox/index.md)
- [Building logging into your project with the stdlib `logging` module](logging.md)

And more. Use the navigation on the left side of the page to browse through sections.
