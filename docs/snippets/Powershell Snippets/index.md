# Powershell Snippets

Code snippets & example script parts for Powershell.

Check the [`one-liners`](./one-liners/index.md) page for Powershell one-liners, meant to be copy-pasted into your terminal, or check the [example scripts](./scripts/index.md) page for files you can save as `.ps1` scripts. Note that most of the examples in the scripts page are partials, things you copy into a script you're writing and build with. Most are not complete scripts that do something when you run them.
